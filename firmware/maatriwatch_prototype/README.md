# MaatriWatch ESP32 prototype

## Wiring — ESP32 DevKit V1

All modules must share **GND**. Use 3.3 V logic/power for the sensor modules.

| ESP32 pin | Connect to | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3V3 | MAX30102 VIN, DHT11 VCC, OLED VCC | Do not use 5 V with an unverified MAX30102/OLED breakout. |
| GND | MAX30102 GND, DHT11 GND, OLED GND | Common ground is mandatory. |
| GPIO 21 | MAX30102 SDA, OLED SDA | I²C bus shared; MAX30102 is normally `0x57`, OLED normally `0x3C`. |
| GPIO 22 | MAX30102 SCL, OLED SCL | I²C bus shared. |
| GPIO 4 | DHT11 DATA | Use a 10 kΩ pull-up to 3V3 if the DHT11 board lacks one. |
| GPIO 27 | One side of push button | Other button side to GND; firmware uses internal pull-up. |

## Power safety

**Never connect a 3.7 V LiPo directly to ESP32 `3V3`, `VIN`, or a sensor.** A
LiPo is 4.2 V when fully charged. With a TP4056-style charger/protection board,
connect battery to `B+`/`B-`; then use the protected `OUT+`/`OUT-` through:

- a regulated **5 V boost converter** to the ESP32 `VIN/5V` pin, or
- a stable **3.3 V buck-boost regulator** to the ESP32 `3V3` pin.

Power the sensors from the ESP32's regulated 3V3 output. Confirm the regulator
can supply ESP32 Wi-Fi current spikes (allow at least 500 mA). Do not charge the
cell while unattended, and use a protected LiPo.

## Flashing

1. Arduino IDE: install **ESP32 by Espressif Systems**; select the exact ESP32
   board and serial port.
2. Install the five libraries named in the sketch header.
3. Copy `secrets.example.h` to `secrets.h`; set the API endpoint, hospital-issued
   `DEVICE_ID`, `DEVICE_KEY`, and the API root CA certificate.
4. Upload. On first boot, connect a hospital phone/laptop to the
   `MaatriWatch-Setup` Wi-Fi network (using `PROVISIONING_PASSWORD`) and complete the captive portal. ESP32
   station mode is the correct internet-connected mode; SoftAP/BLE are suitable
   provisioning transports, not the clinical data channel. [Espressif Wi-Fi documentation](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/wifi.html)
5. Put a finger gently and still over the MAX30102 for 10–20 seconds. The OLED
   first shows **finding rhythm** and a four-second SpO₂ settling indicator;
   after it finds a clean PPG waveform, it keeps the last valid estimate for
   up to 45 seconds so one motion-corrupted window does not blank the display.
   Hold the button 1.2 seconds to issue SOS.

## Reading the OLED and Serial Monitor

The OLED uses a non-blocking pulsing-heart animation and rotating calming
message; it never pauses sensor collection or uploads. It reports:

- `Pulse`: a prototype PPG pulse estimate after finger contact is detected.
- `SpO2`: a prototype ratio-of-ratios estimate after one full four-second
  window is valid. Keep the finger still while it is settling.
- `Air`: DHT11 **ambient** temperature and humidity, not body temperature.
- `BP`: `cuff calibration needed` by default. The watch cannot infer a safe
  blood-pressure value from this single MAX30102 sensor.

For hardware diagnosis, open Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**.
Every two seconds firmware prints `ir`, `red`, `contact`, `samples`, `bpm`,
`spo2`, `pi`, and DHT failure count. With a finger in place, `contact=yes`
must appear and the `samples` count should climb to 100. If it stays at zero
or `contact=no`, re-check the MAX30102 wiring, its 3.3 V supply, and that the
sensor window is fully covered. If `dhtFailures` keeps increasing, re-check
the DHT11 data pin and its pull-up resistor.

## Supervised BP screen demonstration only

The firmware intentionally does **not** calculate, upload, chart, or alert on
blood pressure from MAX30102 data. Research-grade PPG BP systems need a
reference-cuff calibration and clinical validation; this prototype does not
have either. For a supervised UI demonstration only, a clinician may edit
these two constants near the top of the sketch to a **same-session cuff
reading**:

```cpp
constexpr int PROTOTYPE_BP_CUFF_SYSTOLIC = 118;
constexpr int PROTOTYPE_BP_CUFF_DIASTOLIC = 76;
```

The OLED will then show `BP demo: 118/76*`. The asterisk means it is a
manually entered cuff reference, not a value produced by the watch. It is
display-only and is never sent to the dashboard. Restore both constants to
`0` after the demonstration.

## Hospital lifecycle

1. Administrator registers the physical serial number and saves the one-time
   returned device secret in the hospital provisioning record.
2. Doctor/admin assigns the device to the selected patient. Only then will the
   backend accept telemetry from it.
3. Patient logs into the app. The app resolves their patient record, and shows
   the assigned device and its live readings without a separate Bluetooth pair.
4. On return, clinician resolves outstanding alerts, exports/retains records per
   policy, unassigns the watch, rotates its device key, and re-provisions it for
   the next assignment. Keep the Wi-Fi network hospital-controlled; clear stored
   Wi-Fi settings only through a supervised service/reflash procedure when a
   watch moves to a different network.

The DHT11 is intentionally shown only as **ambient** temperature/humidity. It
must not be used as body temperature. MAX30102 pulse/SpO₂ readings from this
prototype are not diagnostic or clinically validated. A single MAX30102 does
not directly measure blood pressure; the dashboard reserves BP for a validated
cuff reading. Do not derive or alert on a maternal BP value without a
patient-specific cuff-calibrated model and a completed validation study.

### Device lifecycle API

The clinician dashboard already displays assigned devices. Until the dedicated
inventory screen is added, an authenticated hospital administrator can register
a device with `POST /api/v1/hospitals/{hospitalId}/devices` and a clinician or
administrator can assign/unassign it with `PATCH
/api/v1/hospitals/{hospitalId}/devices/{deviceId}/assignment`, sending
`{"patient_id":"<uuid>"}` or `{"patient_id":null}`. The registration response
is the only time the backend returns `device_key`; record it securely before
flashing the watch. For a returned or lost watch, `POST
/api/v1/hospitals/{hospitalId}/devices/{deviceId}/rotate-key` invalidates the
old secret and returns a replacement once.
